# Secure Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol

This repository contains resources for a project developed as part of the **Design of Secure Protocols** course. The project explores a secure authentication and key agreement protocol, focusing on aspects of user anonymity and untraceability in 5G-enabled softwarized industrial cyber-physical systems.

## Project Tasks

1. **Presentation**: Created a detailed presentation in LaTeX Beamer to explain the protocol's structure and its secure authentication and key generation mechanisms.
2. **Implementation**: Implemented the protocol using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool to verify its security features and simulate its behavior.

## Paper Overview

The primary reference for this project is the paper:

**"Authenticated key agreement scheme with user anonymity and untraceability for 5G-enabled softwarized industrial cyber-physical systems"** by Anil Kumar Sutrala, Mohammad S. Obaidat, Sourav Saha, Ashok Kumar Das, Mamoun Alazab, and Youngho Park. The paper was published in the *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, Volume 23, Issue 3, 2021, pages 2316â€“2330.

This paper presents a key agreement scheme specifically designed for 5G-enabled industrial cyber-physical systems. The scheme emphasizes secure user authentication, anonymity, and untraceability, which are critical in scenarios where user privacy and data security are paramount. The protocol is evaluated for robustness against various security attacks and optimized for the low-latency, high-speed requirements of 5G systems.
